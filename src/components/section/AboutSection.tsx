          Hey there! I{"'"}m a full-stack Web Developer based in India, and my journey into the realm of software development began around 2021. Since then, I{"'"}ve been on an exciting rollercoaster of learning and creation, constantly fueled by my enthusiasm for building cool stuff.

Over time, I{"'"}ve had the awesome opportunity to dive into various projects and fine-tune my skills. These days, I{"'"}m all about crafting digital experiences that are open to everyone and cater to a wide range of client needs. From the nitty-gritty of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to the magic of ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and even React Native for mobile app development â€“ I{"'"}ve been busy exploring and mastering these technologies.

But wait, there{"'"}s more! I don't just stop at creating websites that work smoothly. I{"'"}m also deeply passionate about making sure they{"'"}re easy for everyone to use, regardless of their abilities. Whether it{"'"}s tweaking a bit of code or architecting an entire REST API, I love the challenge of making things work seamlessly.

Speaking of challenges, I{"'"}m a firm believer in seeking out new ones. That{"'"}s why I'm always on the lookout for fresh opportunities to stretch my skills and knowledge. My portfolio showcases some of the awesome projects.
