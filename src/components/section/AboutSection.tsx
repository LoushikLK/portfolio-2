              Hey there! I{"'"}m a full-stack Web Developer from India, and I
              {"'"}ve been on an exciting rollercoaster of learning and creation
              since around 2021, constantly fueled by my enthusiasm for building
              cool stuff.
            </h3>
            <h3 className="font-semibold tracking-wide text-gray-400">
              These days, I{"'"}m all about crafting digital experiences that
              are open to everyone and cater to a wide range of client needs.
              Over time, I{"'"}ve had the awesome opportunity to dive into
              various projects and fine-tune my skills in technologies like
              JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Python, MongoDB, Firebase, and more.

            <h3 className="font-semibold tracking-wide text-gray-400">
              But wait, there{"'"}s more! I don{"'"}t just stop at creating
              websites that work smoothly. I{"'"}m also deeply passionate about
              making sure they{"'"}re easy for everyone to use, regardless of
              their abilities. Whether it{"'"}s tweaking a bit of code or
              architecting an entire REST API, I love the challenge of making
              things work seamlessly. Speaking of challenges, I{"'"}m a firm
              believer in seeking out new ones. That{"'"}s why I{"'"}m always on
              the lookout for fresh opportunities to stretch my skills and
              knowledge. My portfolio showcases some of the awesome projects I
              have done â€“ watch them below.
